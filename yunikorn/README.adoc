== Automated install of OpenShift 4.5 with Yunikorn scheduler for BigData and ML 
== on your laptop, virtual machine or baremetal server using CodeReady Containers

NOTE: You'll need 16GB of RAM. 

See https://yunikorn.apache.org/


----
From https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/download:

1. Download CodeReady Containers in the current folder. I'm on a Mac so I'm using crc-macos-amd64.tar.xz.
   CodeReady Containers is also available for Linux and Windows.
   
   Select your OS from the dropdown list then Click on "Download". 
   
   You'll be asked to connect using your Red Hat login. 
   
   If you don't have one, just click on "Create one now". You do NOT need a Red Hat subscription for this.

   Once logged in, the following page will be displayed to 
   allow you to download CodeReady Containers AND the pull secret.

----
git clone https://github.com/marcredhat/crcdemos.git

cd crcdemos/keptn

sudo chmod +x ./*.sh

In the current folder (keptn), 
edit crc.sh to configure the memory e.g. 
crc config set memory 16000 (for 16GB of RAM)
crc config set cpus 32 (for 32 logical cores)
----


----
3. Copy  your pull secret to the current folder in a file called pullsecret.txt
----

----
4. Copy the CodeReady Containers archive that you downloaded in step 1 to the current folder
   e.g. crc-macos-amd64.tar.xz if you are on a Mac.
----


----
./crc.sh will extract the CodeReady archive so please edit it to 
make sure it uses the correct archive for your system (Mac or Linux)
